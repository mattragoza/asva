The file asva.py is a Python program for scoring actigraphy data.

Instructions

	Open a terminal program such as cmd on Windows or bash on Mac or Linux.
	Navigate to the folder where asva.py is located on your computer
		using the following command:

		cd <path_to_directory>

	Once in this folder, run the actigraphy scoring progam using one of
		the following commands:

		python asva.py <file_pattern> -o <output_file>
		python asva.py <file_pattern> > <output_file>

	The <file_pattern> argument is how you specify what AWC files you want to score.
	The <output_file> argument is the path for the file to write the output to.

	Say you want to just score one file called TEST.awc which is in the same folder
	as asva.py, and then output it in TEST.csv. You can enter:

		python asva.py TEST.awc -o TEST.csv

	If you have a bunch of AWC files in a folder called "AWC files" which is in 
	the same folder as asva.py, you could instead enter the command as:

		python asva.py "AWC files\*.awc" -o TEST.csv

	Note that if there are spaces or wildcard characters in a filepath, it has to be
	enclosed in quotes. The asterick * is known as a wildcard character, and means
	"grab every	file that matches this pattern". So in this case "AWC files\*.awc"
	argument grabs every file in the "AWC files" directory that has the .awc extension.
	In addition, note that filenames are case-sensitive in most operating systems.
